<h1 id="thirdcake">Thirdcake</h1>
<p>Thirdcake is a Makefile DSL written in Haskell. Write your build logic in Haskell, obtain clean and safe Makefile, distribute it to the end-users. Currenly, GNU Make is required.</p>
<h2 id="installing">Installing</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Install <a href="http://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a></p></li>
<li><p>Install dependencies</p>
<pre><code> $ cabal install haskell-src-meta monadloc QuasiText</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Build the thirdcake from Github</p>
<pre><code> $ git clone http://github.com/grwlf/cake3
 $ cd cake3
 $ cabal configure &amp;&amp; cabal install</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create the Cakefile.hs in the root dir of your project</p>
<pre><code>$ cake3 init
Cakefile.hs has been created</code></pre></li>
<li>Edit Cakefile.hs, fill it with rules you need (refer to Example/Foo)</li>
<li><p>Build Makefile with</p>
<pre><code>$ cake3</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run GNU make as usual</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>Make is a build tool which was created more than 20 yesrs ago. It has a number of versions and dialects. Basic Makefiles are really easy to write and understand. Unfortunately, it is hard to write real-world scale set of rules correctly due to tricky syntax and lots of pitfails. As of today, Make has automatic, declarative and imperative variables, builtin rules, pattern-rules, double-colon rules, C-style ifdefs (which doesn't work well with declarative variables) and lots of other strange things. Nevertheless, it is still widely used as a de-facto standard tool which everyone has access to.</p>
<p>The goals of Thirdcake are to help the developer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop overusing Make by writing complex logic in make-language</li>
<li>Still have a correct Makefile which could be distributed to endusers</li>
<li>Take a bit of Haskell practice :)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features-and-limitations">Features and limitations</h2>
<p>Thirdcake follows Autoconf's path in a sence that it generates Makefile which can be used with current and modified (up to some level) environment but has to be regenerated when environment modifications exceeds that level.</p>
<p>Currently, the tool doesn't support pattern rules and variable-level functions so nearly all the computatinos should be done at Haskell level. However, as a reward, thirdcake protect the develper from a number of common make-specific mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Rebuild a rule when variable changes. Consider following antipattern:</p>
<pre><code># You often write rules like this, don&#39;t you?
out : in
     foo $(FLAGS) -o $@ $^</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, changes in FLAGS don't lead to rebuilding of out. Hardly-trackable bugs may appear if one part of a project was built with one set of optimisation flags and another part was build with another set by mistake.</p>
<p>Thirdcake implements the makevar checksum <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17830736/1133157">pattern</a> from StackOverflow to detect changes in variables and rebuild targets when nessesary.</p></li>
<li><p>A rule with multiple targets</p>
<p>It is not that simple to write a rule which has more than one target. Really,</p>
<pre><code>out1 out2 : in1 in2
    foo in1 in2 -o1 out1 -o2 out2</code></pre>
<p>is not corret. Read this <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Multiple-Outputs.html#Multiple-Outputs">Automake article</a> if you are surprised. Thirdcake implements <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10609434/1133157">.INTERMEDIATE pattern</a> to deal with this problem</p></li>
<li><p>Makefiles hierarchy. Say, we have a project A with subproject L. L has it's own Makefile and we want to re-use it in our global A/Makefile. Make provides only two ways of doing that. We could either include L/Makefile or call $(MAKE) -C L. First solution is a pain because we would probably merge together two files with different current directory assumptions. Second approach is OK, but only if we don't need to pass additional paramters or depend on a specific rule from L.</p>
<p>Thirdcake's approach in this case is a compromise: it uses standard Haskell import mechanism so it is possible to import L/Cakefile.hs from A/Cakefile.hs and do whatever you want to, but resulting makefiles will always be monolitic.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thirdcake doesn't support make-level includes. This is a serious limitation, so I'm going to add that support ASAP.</li>
<li>No support for referencing a makefile-variable from within other variable. Again, lack of time. On the TODO list.</li>
<li>Resulting Makefile is actually a GNUMakefile. GNU extensions (shell function and others) are needed to make variable-guard tricks to work.</li>
<li>Coreutils package is required because resulting Makefile calls md5sum and cut programs.</li>
<li>Cakefiles should have unique names (see below for more details)</li>
<li>Posix environment is required. So, Linux, Probably Mac, Probably Windows+Cygwin.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Thirdcake allows user to write Cakefile.hs in plain Haskell to define rules, targets and other stuff as usual. After that, <code>cake3</code> compiles it into Makefile (ghc is required for that). At this point, make will do the rest.</p>
<p>Again, in more details:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>User writes a cakefile (./Cake*.hs) describing the rules. Refer to Example/Foo/Cakefile.lhs. Note, that different cakefiles should have different names even if they are in different directories due to GHC import restrictions. This way user can import one cakefile from another, as if they were in the same directory. Actually, cake3 copies all cakefiles into one temporary directory and compiles them there.</p></li>
<li><p>User executes <code>cake3</code> which compiles ./Cakefile.hs into <code>./Cakegen</code> and produces Makefile. Note that cake3 expects ./Cakegen to print the the Makefile to it's standard output. Also, cake3 creates ./Cakefile_P.hs containing information about paths. Most important are <em>files</em> function which translates relative <em>filename</em> into <em>&quot;.&quot; &lt;/&gt; path</em>to_root &lt;/&gt; filename_. Also note, that cake3 is a small program which launches a shell-script. That is a trick to workaround cabal restriction which forbids the shipment of non-binary executables.</p></li>
<li><p><code>make</code> can now be used to build the project. Note, that make knows how to update itself, so user doesn't have to run cake3 every time he or she changes ./Cakefile.hs.</p></li>
</ol>
